# 2D-PSD
I was fortunate enough to be a part of the VERITAS/SOAR Program. The program allows community college students to execute research with scientists and engineers of NASAâ€™s VERITAS space mission. 
I distinguished all aspects of the geometry and development of regions with joint sets and grabens on Earth using MATLAB and QGIS that can be used as analogues to Venus tessera terrains.

This script finds the 2D PSD (power spectral density) of a DEM (digital elevation model) file and outputs the signal due to the file's elevation data. I have included some PNG files if you would like
to test around the script. 

The program was developed via MATLAB 2024a.
